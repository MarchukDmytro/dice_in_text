# Dice in text plugin

This plugin allows you to roll dice directly from the text by clicking on text in formats like 3d8+n or 3ะบ8+n . A flat modifier is not necessary, it can be just 3d8.



This works in reader mode as well as in live preview. After text in the correct format is detected, it becomes possible to click on its closing window to pop up in the top right that shows every individual roll, their sum and total sum with a flat modifier.



Also, if on 1d20+n rolled 1 or 20, the window will be red or green for crits.
